2D BLIT System :

Welcome to the 2D BLIT system repository! This project provides a straightforward yet powerful framework for rendering images and animations in a 2D environment using C++.



Key Features :

Pixel Drawing Functionality: Begin by setting up the rendering loop and drawing individual pixels in contrasting colors to ensure correct rendering and positioning.

Tile Rendering and BLIT Functionality: Expand upon pixel drawing by implementing the ability to draw tiles, or square sets of pixels, using a BLIT (BitBLT) approach to efficiently copy image data.

Efficient Image Buffer Handling: Manage the color buffer efficiently to store and manipulate images. Convert 2D image coordinates to 1D array indices for easy access and manipulation.

Horizontal and Vertical Tiling: Fill the color buffer with tiled images both horizontally and vertically to cover the entire screen space, ensuring seamless rendering without border artifacts.

Randomized BLIT Placement: Randomly place multiple BLITs throughout the color buffer to showcase versatility and flexibility in rendering various elements.

Animation Support with Alpha Transparency: Introduce animation capabilities, allowing smooth interpolation of color values and support for alpha transparency for rendering dynamic content.

Animation Iteration and Playback Control: Implement animation iteration over time, ensuring smooth playback at a consistent frame rate of 30 frames per second (fps) for a fluid user experience.
